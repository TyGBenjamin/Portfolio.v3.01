## Installation

Initially you musty have Node installed
Also have to initiliaze the npm command to install the required dependencies which can
be found in the package.json file
After installing these, javascript has to be run from terminal through node in order to launch to the server, which would
then initiate the page.
Ultimately though, the application will be deployed for public use. This would allow for easier access and a more user-friendly interface.

## Usage

Being a web developer means being part of a community. This will be used to not only to share my projects while I'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to show my work with other developers as we collaborated on projects over the course of the past year.

## Preview
